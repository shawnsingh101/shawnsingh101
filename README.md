Hi, I'm Shawn Singh!

I am an Associate Director at the White House in the Office of Presidential Correspondence. I help folks engage with their government to ensure democracy works for them! Part of my role includes analyzing our data, pulling out insights and presenting results for senior staff in a clear and cohesive manner.

Prior to joining the White House, I received my Master's Degree in International Affairs from Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). My concentration was International Finance and Economic Policy with a specialization in Data Analytics and Quantitative Analysis.

Other experiences include working as an ESG Intern Analyst at a brokerage, interning at the State Department analyzing data on multilateral development bank projects in  South and Central Asia (SCA), as well as being a Fulbright Scholar working as an English Teaching Assistant in Uzbekistan. I'm also a proud Teach For America alum, who taught 8th grade science in New Haven, CT.

I am proficient in Python for data analysis, SQL, Excel, STATA, and Tableau.

I hope to leverage the power of data to better inform decisions about public policy and international affairs.
